# 🕵️‍♂️ Secure Lost & Found Portal

A centralized, AI-powered platform designed to streamline the lost and found process for colleges, leveraging Google's Gemini AI for automation and security.

## 🚩 The Problem

Existing systems like notice boards or WhatsApp groups are chaotic, unsearchable, and lack verification. Students risk fraud or safety issues by meeting strangers to recover items.

## 💡 The Solution

Our solution bridges the digital and physical world using a secure, verified workflow:

1. **AI-Powered Reporting:** Finders scan items with Gemini Vision to auto-fill details (No manual typing!).
2. **Blind Verification:** A "Zero-Knowledge" proof system where the AI validates ownership claims without revealing hidden item details publicly.
3. **Digital Gate Pass:** A secure, one-time code generated for the physical handover at the Admin Desk.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **🔐 Domain-Locked Security:** Restricted strictly to `@iare.ac.in` emails.
* **🤖 Gemini Vision Integration:** Detects object type, brand, and color from photos instantly.
* **⚖️ AI Judge:** Using Gemini 1.5 Flash to compare "Hidden Details" vs. "Client Proof" for fraud prevention.
* **🎫 Digital Audit Trail:** Generates a unique pickup code to ensure accountability during handover.
* **📱 Real-Time Dashboard:** Live feed of Lost & Found items with smart search.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Google Ecosystem)

* **Frontend:** React.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism UI)
* **Auth:** Firebase Authentication (Identity Platform)
* **Database:** Cloud Firestore (Real-time NoSQL)
* **Storage:** Cloud Storage for Firebase (Image Hosting)
* **AI:** Google Gemini Pro Vision & Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Cloud Functions)
* **Backend:** Google Cloud Functions (Serverless Node.js)

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

* **Semantic Search:** "Find me a bottle with a superhero sticker" (Vector Embeddings).
* **Gamification:** Reputation points & canteen coupons for honest finders.
* **Geo-Fencing:** Location-based alerts for lost items nearby.
